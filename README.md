Comic-books-browser
===================

This sample is target at smoothing the browsing .

My exp:

i'v been look much comic books website , when you click next page , it will

reload the page again , so i use ajax to solve this problem , but the browser has to

remember what you looked 


==========

its get the content data by ajax , so if you click next page

or last page , the browse will not remember what you looked ,

so this sample implements the html5 history api , 

if you click last page or next page , its remember all .
